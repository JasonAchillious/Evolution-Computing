## Optimising TSP (Assignment 1)
The main task of this section is applying Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to optimising Travelling Salesman
Problems (TSPs). 

The traveling salesman problem(TSP) is a combinatorial optimization problem that can be mathematically modeled as a problem of searching the optimal permutation. 
This research describes a model for mutation in the evolution algorithm(EA) and adopts group theory to the demonstration of the global optimal promise for mutation. 
Also, this research uses a simple framework of EA to compare the performances of different mutation operators. 
The experimental results show the degeneration under this simple framework and all the mutation operators perform the same well as each other.
